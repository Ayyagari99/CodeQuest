# CODE QUEST!

CodeQuest is a web based treasure hunt developed with HTML, CSS and Javascript. The game has five levels. Each levels has the following parts:<br />
1)A Data Structures and Algorithm based question <br /> 
2)A riddle which will lead the participant to a location <br />
At the location, a QR code is hidden which when scanned displays an Avengers-themed question. The answer to this question has to be entered in order to proceed to the next level<br />

The team which solves maximum number of questions in minimum time is the clear winner. This game was successfully hosted for about 150 participants.

# Acknowledgement:
Would like to thank Innerve'19 for providing us the platform to host the same.

# A small catch:
Pressing 'Enter' will not submit the answers. <br \> 
The timer was specific to the day the Code Quest was held, so it won't work. <br \>
(Nevertheless, Code Quest can still be played without the timer)
