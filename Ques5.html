            <p> Iron man is man of equality. He needs your help to divide his "powers" evenly amongst all his followers. 
                By doing this, Iron man can create equality amongst his followers and he'll be called a true "power".
                Iron man has N powers, and K followers. Each power is given a numerical value which shows its intensity.
                Your task is to determine whether it is possible to allocate all the powers to followers in such a way 
                that the sum of intensities of the powers allocated to each follower is equal. Note : A power can be allocated to only one of the followers.
                <br>Input<br>
                The first line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.
                 The first line of each case contains two integers N and K, with N denoting the number of powers and K denoting the number of
                followers. In the next line are N space separated integers denoting the intensities of each power.
                <br>Output<br>
                For each test case, output "yes" if it is possible to divide his powers equally amongst his followers; otherwise output "no" (without quotes).
                <br><br>Constraints<br>
                <br>	1 <= T <= 10
                <br> 1 <= N <= 21
                <br>1 <= K <= 8
                <br> Subtask #1 (20 points) : 0 <= intensity of power <= 10^5
                <br>Subtask #2 (80 points) : 0 <= intensity of power <= 10^10
